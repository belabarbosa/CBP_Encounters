# CBP Encounters Project

## Context

I have been living in Rio Grande Valley, South Texas, since 2017. By being only a few minutes from Mexico, discussions about U.S. Customs and Border Protection activities are part of my everyday life. The men and women that work protecting the Southwest Border are part of our community and it is common for us to see them driving around the town, eating in the local restaurants and participating in community events.
In the last years I have been seeing an increase in the number of news and social media discussions regard the encounters of individuals along the Border. 

As a data analyst, I wanted to study if all the buzz was fundamented and that was what drove me to do this analysis. The data used was downloaded from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection [website](https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/nationwide-encounters), this analysis was produced for study purpose only and even though I am using U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, this analysis is not endorsed by CBP.

## Initial questions

These are the questions that I was aiming to answer with this analysis.

- Is CBP workload increasing?
- If so, which region of the Border is driving this increase the most?
- From what countries are majority of these individuals coming from?

## Insights

## Next steps

Based on the results of this analyze, and possessing some different datasets, it is possible to go further and study other aspects related to CBP activities. Here are some examples:

- Compare the countries of the encounters and the ones from immigration.
-	See if the percentage of hires is proportional to the increase of workload.
- See if there is a relation between the increase of the encounters and the change of political party in power.
- How has the top ten countries of the encounters changed over the years?
